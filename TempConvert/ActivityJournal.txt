Name: Griffin Isaac

================================================================
Start Part 1
Estimated Time	01 10
Plan: implement basic commands, set up program, test program, repeat untill desired result is reached. 
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
Make code, test, format spacing, test, take things one step at a time fixing issues as they arise
Complete
Actual Time	02 00
Observations: compiles failed: 8
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
figured out order of operations and how to do it. additionally i learned how to reorder a fraction to use instead of a double value, and that float values could also be used as fractions. finally, i learned how to format a print statement to print the information out properly.

================================================================
Start Part 2
Estimated Time	01 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
build compile, ect, just doing the work
Complete
Actual Time	01 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
I learned how to set the amount of decimal point son a float operator, otherwise it was the same problems as above, minus an hour of just plugging the computer in and restoring files
